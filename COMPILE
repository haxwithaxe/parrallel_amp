Bulk copper should be grounded. Otherwise, the extra copper will float, degrading noise rejection and phase margins.

LibreOffice Calc (spreadsheet) can take an HTML copy/pasted from a web browser. From there, prices can be added after stripping extraneous description information with the following regex: \ [^0-9].*
